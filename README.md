THESE ARE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS::
Command line arguments are an elementary skill that you must learn how to use, especially if you are trying to apply more advanced computer vision, image processing, or deep learning concepts.


What are command line arguments?
Command line arguments are flags given to a program/script at runtime. They contain additional information for our program so that it can execute.
Not all programs have command line arguments as not all programs need them.

Why do we use command line arguments?
As stated, command line arguments give additional information to a program at runtime.

This allows us to give our program different input on the fly without changing the code.
We cancan draw the analogy that a command line argument is similar to a function parameter.
